- Ideally, you can deliver the challenge within 10 days. But if you need more time, let us know 😊

## The Challenge

### About the layout

The [following Figma layout needs to be developed](https://www.figma.com/file/RG2Ro8NwAt1HsMASwbZcUx/Teste-Front-end-2?node-id=2%3A7938).

The logo is the same as the one in the repository.

It's important to say that it is just a prototype! We would also like to see your ability to propose improvements, features and new contributions to the product's UI 😄!

**Feel completely free** to make improvements such as:

- Adding new functionalities;
- Creating animations;
- Developing visual optimizations;
- etc

You also can add new filters if you want 😋

### About the API

The JSON that you need to develop for this application is available at:

- `https://jsm-challenges.s3.amazonaws.com/frontend-challenge.json`

Feel free to use BFF (Back-end for Front-end) before using it on the client-side, if you think that if it makes sense 👀!

### About the project

You **should** develop:

- Filter by state;
- Search by name and/or last name;
- Pagination to navigate between cards;
- Navigation when clicking on customer cards;
- An **internal page** with more details of customers (use your creativity);
- We'll be happy (😍) **if you write tests** for it.
